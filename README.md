Student help desk technician is optimized for course registration and student results.
Whenever any student goes for registration a course. He has no idea, how many courses did he drop or fail. If he takes any drop or fails a course, whether it will overlap his regular courses.

So our goal to easier course registration for regular student or irregular student and so on. By Monitors all student previous records related to his courses and also current semester offered course. Also, All the offered courses are published on the university notice board. The student doesn't see the list online. This site fixes that problem easily.
